# CPSC210 Personal Project - Tetris

## Proposal
### What will the application do?
The application will be a playable version of *Tetris*.
The game will have a feature allowing players to track their highscores,
as well as some different game modes. The plan right now is to have
a highscore mode where a player has a set number of time to clear as many
lines as possible, a time trial mode where the goal is to clear a set number
of lines in the shortest possible time, and an endless mode where the game
does not end until the player runs out of space to put blocks. Regardless of 
the game mode, a Tetris game ends when the player runs out of space on the board.
This can be avoided by filling in horizontal lines which makes them disappear.

### Who will use it?
Really anyone that likes to play *Tetris* and is looking for an offline
version of the game. The most popular version right now is found on an 
online website called Jstris, and I have yet to find a good offline
version of the game for myself.

### Why is this project of interest to you?
I enjoy playing *Tetris* and would like to be able to play the game offline,
since there are no good offline versions.

## Phase 1:
### User Stories
1. As a user I want to be able to see the highscores.
2. As a user I want to be able to see the next Tetrominos in queue.
3. As a user I want to be able to have some keyboard controls.
4. As a user I want to be able to 

## Appendix

### Terminology
I might be using some terminology that might be new or unclear to people that
have never played the game, so I will define any such terms under this heading.
- **Line**: A horizontal slice of a tetris board, usually contains at 
least one square.
- **Clearing a line**: Filling in a line, making it disappear.
- **Tetrominos**: The basic shapes of Tetris. They are made of different 
arrangements of squares. See the image below for examples.
(Note: Left handed versions of the L and the offset square shape exist 
as well)
